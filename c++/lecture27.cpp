    // definition - a class inherite rom 1 base class 
    // structure - 1 parent 1 child
    // use cases - simple relationship where 1 class need to extend another without complicity parent -> child

    // multilevel inheritance
    // a class inherits from a derived class forming a chain 
    // parent -> child -> grandchild
    // usefule for hierarchial classification

    // multiple inheritance
    // a class inherites from multiple base classes
    // when a class need to combine functionality from different sources

    // hierarchical inheritance
    // multiple class inherite from the same base class
    // useful for categorosing different types that share common features

    // hybrid inheritance 
    // combination of 2 or more 
    // can be mixed with various structures as well as share common features
