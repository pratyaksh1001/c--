# overloading

in function overloading it can occur without or with inheritance

# overiding

it can occur when 1 class is inherited from another class

* in function overloading must have different signature of function
* in function overriding must have same signature
* overloading - it is a concept of compile time polimorphism
* overiding - it is a concept of runtime polymorphism
* in function overloading we declare more than 1 function with same name and different types of params
* in function overiding we declare a function in base class and derived class with the same name and same params

# virtual function

virtual functions allow derived class to override a function defined in a base class where the function that gets called is determined at runtime based on the object type

# pure virtual

it is a virtual function that has no implementations in the base class and it is declared by assigning 0

# abstract class

you can't live in blueprint it need to be turned into a real house(derived class)

it can have functions that does not have any details this is known as a pure virtual function

you cannot create an object firectly from an abstract class you need to make a new class that use the abstract class

# order of execution



# polymorphism


# virtual distructor

it ensures proper cleanup in class hierarchy
