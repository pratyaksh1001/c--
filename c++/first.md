overloading - in function overloading it can occur without or with inheritance

overiding - it can occur when 1 class is inherited from another class

* in function overloading must have different signature of function
* in function overriding must have same signature
* overloading - it is a concept of compile time polimorphism
* overiding - it is a concept of runtime polymorphism
* in function overloading we declare more than 1 function with same name and different types of params
* in function overiding we declare a function in base class and derived class with the same name and same params

# virtual function

virtual functions allow derived class to override a function defined in a base class where the function that gets called is determined at runtime based on the object type


# pure virtual

it is a virtual function that has no implementations in the base class and it is declared by assigning 0
